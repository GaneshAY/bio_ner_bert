# Finetuning SciBERT on NER downstream task
This repository contains code to finetune BERT-based models on Named Entity Recogniton downstream tasks.
A part from just providing the code to train a BERT-based NER, the idea is to provide results for several 
biomedical datasets as well as the models (that will be uploaded into [HuggingFace models](https://huggingface.co/models))
